# Monocular-Fiber-Bundle-Image-Depth-Estimation
This work present a depth estimation network and pipeline for monocular fiber-bundle endoscopic images, which are difficult to make reliable depth recovery due to low resolution, low contrast, related artifacts ( like honeycomb artifacts ) and the absence of ground-truth.

The phantom and exvivo datasets for training and the pretrained models have been placed in the Google Drive links respectively:
